excerpt: Accidentally inspired by my colleagues during a casual chat, I developed
  the the ESP32-powered Bluetooth Low Energy button that triggers shell commands on
  a Mac.
---
<p style="text-align:justify;">A couple of months ago I did a strong effort towards automating build-related tasks of our iOS app at <a href="http://lab.getbase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Base</a> (you can read more on that in <a href="http://kapusta.cc/2018/01/09/reducing-tech-debt-in-base-ios-app-part-3-automation/">my previous blog post</a>). The result was amazing, especially when it comes to preparing AppStore submissions, that normally require <a href="https://kapustacc.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-05-at-13-01-33.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more effort</a> than just doing a release build. Our team really enjoyed the new tools:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_452" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-452" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hipchat-triggered-e1515998330458.png?w=2048" alt="hipchat-triggered"/> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMS2VnDveP8[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Siri support aside, the button instantly caught my attention. It sounded like a simple project with (somewhat) real-life use case. My friend was in need and I could help him out, possibly sparking his and our other colleagues' interest in learning more about embedded programming. And, after all, you always wanted a big button on your desk for whatever purpose, admit it.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">Scope</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I defined the following requirements straight off:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The button would connect to the computer and run a predefined command. Fastlane runs in terminal so I assumed it would first open a system shell and then execute the command.</li>
<li>The wired connection is so 2000, the Wi-Fi connection is too much and not really handy ⇒ Bluetooth Low Energy sounds just fine. I know close to nothing about it (barring mobile apps working with BLE beacons), but that's fine since I'm going to learn it.</li>
<li>I could write a client app on the OS X that would connect to the button, and allow for configuring its action. I'm normally doing roughly one OS X app every 4 years and it was about time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Hardware</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remember I said I knew nothing about Bluetooth? That's true to the extent that I wasn't sure whether I'd achieve what I wanted with Bluetooth Low Energy, or I needed to go with Bluetooth Classic. I also wanted to cut costs a little bit, so I decided to give it a try with <a class="" href="http://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-wroom-32/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller</a> from Espressif Systems. It's a very powerful dual-core chip with WiFi, BLE, and Bluetooth Classic connectivity, and it measures a mere 18x25.5mm with integrated PCB antenna included.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_454" align="aligncenter" width="1532"]<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-454" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/esp-ali.png" alt="esp-ali.png"/> Cutting costs pretty aggressively actually.[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has a 1.27mm raster which meant some serious SMD effort just to connect wires to it, so I ordered two chips in case I fail, and planned to solder it to the ESP-32-specific 2.54mm raster adapter.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Fun</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the most crucial part of the device, the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adafruit Massive Arcade Button</a> was the obvious ideal candidate. It features a 10cm diameter dome with an LED backlight, and since I saw it for the first time I was looking for a good enough excuse to finally get it.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">Ready, set, go!</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One month later when the package from Singapore arrived, I was ready to get my hands dirty. It was a very wise decision to order two chips, as it didn't take long till I failed at putting the first one on the adapter. I didn't notice the slight misalignment in the left upper area and made several short circuits, and then unsoldering the chip using decent temperature was too much for my skills.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_455" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class=" size-large wp-image-455 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/adapter-fail.jpg?w=2048" alt="adapter-fail"/> How to: waste your shiny new ESP-WROOM-32 by soldering it misaligned.[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If that was not enough of a bad luck, I wasted the other chip in a similar way just a few moments later. (I thought) I soldered it properly this time (without obviously visible misalignments), but still, something went wrong, as I lost the connection to the chip soon after I powered it up.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Step back. Regroup.</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having failed so miserably I resorted to getting a dedicated development board. I thought I'd do it the right way – start off with the dev board, and having figured out the working prototype, I'd replace it with a bare microcontroller and only the required circuitry. Luckily enough I got an <a href="http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/get-started-devkitc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESP-DevKitC</a> just before the Christmas break.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">Prototype</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The circuit is really simple – here's what's needed:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>1x ESP-32 dev board,</li>
<li>1x tact switch,</li>
<li>1x LED,</li>
<li>1x resistor (to limit the LED current).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The LED (and the resistor) could be omitted but since it's already provided with the Adafruit dome button, let's make some use of it.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_456" align="aligncenter" width="2560"]<img class=" size-full wp-image-456 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/esp-devkitc.jpg" alt="esp-devkitc"/> Simple as that.[/caption]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Working principle</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I imagined the big picture the following way:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>the button device is a BLE accessory, just like a heart rate monitor,</li>
<li>the computer is a client that connects to the button; it can be configured to run a predefined command when triggered,</li>
<li>when the button is pressed, it notifies the client; it also switches on the LED to indicate a busy state,</li>
<li>the client acknowledges the notification and runs a command,</li>
<li>when the command finishes, the client updates the button so that it turns off the LED and waits to be pressed again.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">First run</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like I mentioned earlier, I was new to Bluetooth Low Energy, especially server-side, and then I was also new to ESP-32 and <a href="https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">esp-idf development environment</a>. Having spent some quality time coding in MicroPython for <a href="http://pycom.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pycom</a> boards, I was pretty upset to realize that at the moment ESP-32 MicroPython still lacks some of the chip's features, including Bluetooth APIs. This meant that I had to resort to plain C programming in FreeRTOS environment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fortunately, I was able to base my work on the GATT Server example of the esp-idf, and adjust it to my needs, removing unnecessary code and adding handlers for the button and the LED.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some trial-and-error fiddling with both the development board and the OS X app I was extremely happy to see them interact with each other:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vimeo 251331227 w=640 h=360]</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">Implementation</h1>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Server (the button)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Going into details, the button implements the GATT Server, and the computer acts as a GATT client. The Server defines two services:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>trigger</em> – with the read-only characteristic with notification capability, sent out when pressing the button,</li>
<li><em>idle</em> – with write-only characteristic, accepting a boolean value (effectively only the <code>true</code> value) to indicate that the task finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Client (the computer)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Client searches for peripherals with mentioned services. Once found and connected, it sets the <em>idle</em> characteristic to <code>true</code> and requests notifications for the <em>trigger </em>characteristic. In the UI it allows for defining a command (or set of commands) to be passed to the Terminal.app for execution.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_460" align="aligncenter" width="398"]<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-460" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/buildbutton-osx1.png?w=600" alt="buildbutton-osx"/> So much for the UI.[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now for the tricky part: <strong>figuring out when the command finished</strong>. Since the app passes control to the external application (Terminal.app), to know when Terminal.app is done running a command, it needs to handle some kind of inter-process communication. Which is not a big deal, at least compared to <em>how to tell the other app to notify my app back</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Inter-process communication in MacOS X</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Well, in case of Terminal.app, it runs a system shell so we can easily inject some command into the shell to do a callback for the BuildButton.app. As it comes to the IPC itself, there are several solutions for OS X ranging from a shared file on disk to using Mach ports. I ended up somewhere in between by using the oldie but goodie <strong>Apple Script</strong>. With its funny, naïve syntax and the ability to expose virtually any behaviour to the app's scripting interface I believed it was the right tool for the job here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For opening up the Terminal and running a command, I came up with the following helper script:</p>
<p><pre><code class="AppleScript">on runInTerminal(command)
    tell application &quot;Terminal&quot;
      activate
      set newTab to do script(command)
    end tell
    return newTab
end runInTerminal
</code></pre></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the command itself had to contain the actual user-defined list of commands, plus a callback to our app:</p>
<p><pre><code class="Swift">let argument = { () -&gt; String in
    let finishCommand = &quot;osascript -e 'tell application \\\&quot;BuildButton\\\&quot; to finish'&quot;
    if commandToRun.isEmpty {
        return finishCommand
    }
    // commandToRun is the user-defined command
    return &quot;\(commandToRun); \(finishCommand)&quot;
}()
</code></pre></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What does it mean to <em>tell application "BuildButton" to finish</em>? Have a look at the definition:</p>
<p><pre><code class="xml">&lt;command name=&quot;finish&quot; code=&quot;bbfinish&quot; description=&quot;Finish current task.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;cocoa class=&quot;BuildButton.FinishCommand&quot;&gt;
&lt;/command&gt;
</code></pre></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It tells the app to use <code>FinishCommand</code>, which is a subclass of <code>NSScriptCommand</code> and does the actual job of updating the <em>idle</em> characteristic of the button.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">The dedicated button circuit</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-471" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dome.gif?w=338" alt="dome"/>Since the dev board prototype turned out working fine, I could finally order THE BUTTON, and design a PCB for the circuit. I also decided to give it a last shot with soldering the bare ESP-32 chip to the adapter and I finally got it right :D</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first version of a circuit contains the following components:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>3xAAA battery power supply (4.5V),</li>
<li>3.3V step-up/step-down voltage regulator for the ESP-32,</li>
<li>9V step-up voltage regulator for the LED (I was told it's for 5-12V but I was short of time and I didn't want to risk it not working or flashing too dim),</li>
<li>an additional circuitry for the chip to work fine: power supply capacitors, and EN and IO0 pin pull-up resistors,</li>
<li>button interface,</li>
<li>LED interface,</li>
<li>programming interface (UART + VCC/GND).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the schematic:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-465" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sch1.png" alt="sch.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I copied over some part of it (like EN/IO0 and power supply capacitors) directly from the schematic of ESP-DevKitC which is available <a href="https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/ESP32-Core-Board-V2_sch.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>. If you take a closer look at my schematic, you'll notice that it's highly unoptimized, e.g. it includes two DC voltage regulator circuits: a step-up 9V for the LED and a step-up/step-down 3.3V for the chip. Firstly, it's a pretty expensive solution, and also the 9V regulator drains about 1mA of constant current when idle, with significant impact on battery life.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Power supply issues</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did some initial bare board testing with the circuit similar to this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" size-large wp-image-467 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/protoboard.jpg?w=2048" alt="protoboard"/></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I couldn't get it to work because the chip was constantly restarting right after booting up. The console output showed the following message:</p>
<p><pre><code class="plaintext">Brownout detector was triggered
</code></pre></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means that the power supply can't deliver high enough voltage to drive the microcontroller. In my case, I was powering it from my computer's USB port via the USB-UART adapter, which should deliver a solid 3.3V for up to at least around 500mA. I also tried the same with a 3.7V Li-ion battery and the standalone regulated DC adapter with no luck. Then I decided to have a look at the program I was running on the ESP.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I tried it with a simple hello world example, everything worked fine. But every time I initialized Bluetooth, the brownout detector fired and restarted the device. This must have been caused by a high current peak occurring when powering up Bluetooth. And that's what the bulk capacitor sitting between power supply lines is supposed to handle – cover the current peaks with its charge. In my case, however, it didn't work with a capacitor placed on the breadboard. When I later dug into the topic I learned that this capacitor:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>should be added as close to the chip power input as possible – apparently, a 20cm wire between the breadboard and the microcontroller is not close enough,</li>
<li>should be of high quality, i.e. low impedance – the regular electrolytic capacitor is actually quite the opposite.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even trying to place the huge (680uF) electrolytic capacitor so close that it directly touched the power input pins didn't work. I ended up disabling the brownout detector in my chip, which is obviously not recommended*, but it didn't cause any unexpected crashes in my case. I still ordered a bunch of low ESR SMD capacitors and hoped it would work on the final PCB.</p>
<hr />
<p>[*] - you usually risk the undefined behaviour in places where the logic level cannot be determined due to the voltage being too low for a logic one, yet too high for a logic zero</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Printed board design</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the PCB, I wanted it to be some kind of a "hat" on top of the ESP adapter board:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_466" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-466" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2018-01-15-at-22-17-48.png?w=2048" alt="Screen Shot 2018-01-15 at 22.17.48"/> Quite a tight fit for a hand-made PCB, if you ask me.[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the dome button itself is huge and it needs an even bigger case, I went with a reasonably small form factor, and the final board looked like this:</p>
<p>[gallery ids="470,468,469" type="rectangular" link="file"]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With help of some velcro and a glue gun I managed to put everything in a box:</p>
<p>[gallery ids="472,473" type="rectangular"]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And give it a proper test:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vimeo 251343761 w=640 h=360]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, with the bulk capacitor soldered just millimeters away from the VCC/GND pins I managed to get rid of the brownout issues!</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">Recap</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I must say that when I thought of doing the button for the first time, I had no idea just how much work it would require. After all, it sounds extremely simple, you press a button and it does one simple thing on the Mac. Obviously the requirement of using plain C language for the ESP32 app had huge impact on my perceived effort of this project. And while the device does its job already and I can showcase it to people and get very positive feedback (again, who doesn't like big arcade-style push buttons), it's not yet ready to be left alone in the office for the guys to actually trigger builds with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Have a look at the short list of features:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>it can connect to the client app and remember it</li>
<li>it, most importantly, can trigger a client app to run a command</li>
<li>it does the pulse/heartbeat LED flashing when the command is run; the heartbeat stops when done, or it can be turned off by pressing the button again while running the command (it effectively resets the button state to idle)</li>
<li>it goes to deep sleep after 20s of inactivity (very short time, to conserve battery); when pressed during deep sleep it starts advertising and if the remembered client connects to it, it sends trigger notification - but this adds a 2-3s delay.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And for bugs, or stuff that's missing:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The device drains around 1500uA when sleeping, and I bet it's due to the sophisticated voltage regulators I used for both the chip and the LED circuit. Skipping these regulators should have reduced the deep sleep battery drain, and I'm going to give it a try.</li>
<li>The ESP-32 drains up to 150mA when Bluetooth is active and LED is flashing and it's a ridiculously high current. I tried optimizing it by e.g. clocking down the CPU, disabling one of the cores, limiting Bluetooth radio power but no luck so far. I don't use WiFi when the chip is running, and the LED current is less than 10mA. It may be that ESP-32 is simply not the right tool for this job. The Nordic Semiconductor's nRF51822 would probably work much longer, but would possibly require even more work (...?)</li>
<li>Switching between clients is not sorted out yet – for now it needs the currently paired client app to disconnect (e.g. by quitting the app) in order to connect to the other one. I wanted as minimal UI as possible in the device, so I ended up with just one button. I recently implemented the long press recognizer and I'll try to add pairing mode there.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And so on and so on... Even if the project is unfinished, it gave me yet another solid lesson of embedded systems. I was able to learn about esp-idf, basics of Bluetooth Low Energy, soldering 1.27mm raster integrated circuits just to name a few. Oh and AppleScript, obviously :)</p>
<p>Also, you know it was worth the effort, when people want to have such a button right after you showcase it to them. And when you give an awesome talk on improving iOS apps build performance and automating tasks, but the main topic on Q&amp;A is <em>how does the button work?</em>:</p>
<p>https://www.facebook.com/lodzwiosluje/videos/1221621174637929/</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I'll still be tinkering with the button as time permits, trying to make something shippable. The up-to-date code is available on GitHub, for both <a href="https://github.com/ayoy/the-build-button-esp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the button itself</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ayoy/the-build-button-osx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the client app</a>. Stay tuned for more weird stuff!</p>
