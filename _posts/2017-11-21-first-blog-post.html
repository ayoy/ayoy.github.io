  Hello and welcome to my blog!
  For starters, let me quickly tell you why it's even online.

  Come January it's gonna be 7 years since I started developing for Apple ecosystem. I feel pretty confident about my daily work skills, but for some time I kept realizing I almost forgot the old stuff I was once fluent with.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hello and welcome to my blog!<br />
For starters, let me shortly tell you why it's even online.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I've been in the IT industry for almost 10 years already. Having graduated in electronic engineering I needed to learn a lot in a short time to ramp up as a software engineer. I worked as C++ developer for a couple of years and then I began embracing Objective-C and iOS SDK (version 4 at that time).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Come January it's gonna be 7 years since I started developing for Apple ecosystem. I feel pretty confident about my daily work skills (having spent that much time, too bad if I wasn't...), but for some time I kept realizing I almost forgot the old stuff I was once fluent with. Not to mention that my previous knowledge got obsoleted with the release of new C++ standard. Two of them actually. Three, if you include C++17.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A year ago I bought a Raspberry Pi to have some fun with Linux + embedded stuff. After playing with it for a couple of days I put it on a shelf and forgot about it. I could barely recall anything related to electronic circuits, and having just another Linux box, even if small and <em>portable</em> (considering AC adapter with long enough cable), wasn't too sexy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had another try this year aiming to learn those things again, and this time it clicked. I did the necessary reading to kick off properly, figured out some real life projects to work on, and actually ended up digging even deeper than I initially expected. As my pet projects are getting into shape, I keep expanding their scope so that I could learn even more from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is precisely what pushed me towards starting a blog. I'll hopefully be sharing some posts describing my work, learning process, ideas, decisions and outcomes (including failures). Where I work we're saying <em>It's nil till you ship it</em>, so I could probably rephrase it as <em>It's nil till it's velcroed to the frame of your bed and the world doesn't know about it</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ultimately, I still do iOS development and I'm passionate about it. I'm happy to be a part of <a href="https://lab.getbase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Base CRM</a> team where I work with some of the most skilled people I know. Having already started a blog, it's a great opportunity to shed some light on what we've been up to in a big, mature and complex project such as Base iOS client application.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stay tuned, I hope there will be more to come!</p>
