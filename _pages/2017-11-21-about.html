<p style="text-align:justify;">I am a software engineer and I do iOS development to make a living. I however occasionally enjoyÂ flirting with embedded electronics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the modern era of high-level programming languages, I sometimes find myself longing for pointer arithmetics, bit manipulation, or at least some solid C++ coding. It might be that I'm getting old, but I'd rather keep up that drive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It's me in the photo. A glimpse of what I normally do on weekends. Not the perfect aero tuck here, but I like this pic a lot. And I have since lowered the front by a significant margin ;)</p>
